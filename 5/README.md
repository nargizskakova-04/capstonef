I'll calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall of the classifier using the provided confusion matrix.
First, let me identify the values from the confusion matrix:

True Positives (TP): 200 (Actual: Cat, Predicted: Cat)
False Negatives (FN): 300 (Actual: Cat, Predicted: Not Cat)
False Positives (FP): 120 (Actual: Not Cat, Predicted: Cat)
True Negatives (TN): 180 (Actual: Not Cat, Predicted: Not Cat)

Now, let me calculate each metric:
Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions among the total number of predictions.
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Accuracy = (200 + 180) / (200 + 180 + 120 + 300)
Accuracy = 380 / 800
Accuracy = 0.475 or 47.5%
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Precision = 200 / (200 + 120)
Precision = 200 / 320
Precision = 0.625 or 62.5%
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
Recall = 200 / (200 + 300)
Recall = 200 / 500
Recall = 0.4 or 40%
Therefore:

Accuracy: 47.5%
Precision: 62.5%
Recall: 40%


The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a classifier's performance. It's particularly useful when you have an uneven class distribution.

To calculate the F1-Score, I'll use the precision and recall values I previously calculated:

Precision = 0.625 (62.5%)
Recall = 0.4 (40%)
The formula for F1-Score is:
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

Substituting our values:
F1 = 2 × (0.625 × 0.4) / (0.625 + 0.4)
F1 = 2 × 0.25 / 1.025
F1 = 0.5 / 1.025
F1 = 0.4878 or approximately 0.488

Therefore, the F1-Score for this classifier is 0.488 or 48.8%.

This relatively low F1-Score (below 0.5) indicates that the classifier has moderate performance issues with balancing precision and recall in identifying cats.
